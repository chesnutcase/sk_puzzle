# Letting Go

15 September 2018

I'm certain that God exists, because he's fucking with me and possibly some others.

The ones that he doesn't fuck with â€“ they're *privileged*. They have the privilege of getting what they want, whether they work for it or not.

Today marks my twentieth birthday and possibly the seventh year in a row where I didn't *want* to celebrate it with the people I wanted to. Possibly also the most miserable of all, but I reckon this record would be short-lived like the ones before.

I spent the most of the day sleeping alone in my dormitory room. I cried alone and banged on the walls and cupboards hoping someone would hear me, but of course no one did. It's a fucking Saturday. Everyone else went home. The ones who don't go home, they have others who they care about and are cared for in return.

Ah yes, home. I was repeatedly asked to go home to celebrate the day with them. I didn't want to. I hate celebrating it with people who would impressionably treat me so kindly for one day before returning back to normal the day after. I stayed way clear of celebrating it in the past and I want to continue doing so.

I'm estranged with my home and its dwellers. My home is two streets away but I feel like I live two straits apart.

But its not the issue of celebrating my birthday that prompted me to write this. It would be ironic to say that I don't like my birthday being a special day but yet took the time to write something like this.

You see comrade, at this point of time I'm on the verge of fulling accepting the fact that if you're not fated to do so, you will never get what you want despite how hard you work for it.

You will never achieve your goals no matter how hard you work for it, if someone up there says no. Your ambitions will never work out. You will not form meaningful bonds with people. The collective will never recognise you for your efforts, and individuals will never love you back no matter how much you care for them.

Does the problem lie with others or with me? Concluding the former will lead to nothing as I can't change the heart of others.

It won't work out.

No one gives a shit if you live or die.

If you're no longer around, others would just find someone to replace you.

You are **disposable**.

There's little meaning to this. I once joked to a single colleague nearing his forties about how investing in human relationships is akin to the sunken cost fallacy. Now I'm not just on the receiving end of the joke, I believe that I have become the subject of the joke as well.

There's little I can do to change this. My story nears its end. No matter how much you stare at the pages the number of pages will not change.

You can't change the feelings of a black hole. No matter how much you invest in them. No matter how much you care or think of them. Whatever you throw at them they just take it and throw it somewhere your mortal cognition can't envision. The only thing that can change that is another black hole where they literally open up to each other. The privileged ones have other black holes conveniently placed near them when they start out.

And I am not one of them. Fuck you, God. I'm done.
